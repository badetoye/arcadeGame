## Instructions

The bugs are the Enemies. You are the Player. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. Once you collide with an enemy, you lose and you will be returned to the initial position *'The grass'*. If you successfully pass the obstacle and cross to the *'Water'*,you win! you will also be returned to the initial position to continue until you complete all the levels. That's when you are considered a winner. The game's highest level is *'Level 10'*. The level gets more difficult at every four successful pass. The higher the level, the more the bugs you encounter as the obstacle.
